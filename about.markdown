Hi, I'm Jungwoo. I am currently working as a developer. I majored in Industrial & Management Engineering in Pohang University of Science and Technology. I have mostly dealt with backend systems in my career. I enjoy working with Clojure, Typescript, Javascript, Python, and OCaml and am interested in Minor Languages. Outside of technology, I am interested in organizational culture and team building. I am a high performer and more productive when given autonomy.
