I have been working at Unity for 6 months now. One sentence summary: I am happy to be here. Nice people, great work, and a good environment. Nothing prevents me from doing my best work. The product that I am working on is running well, so we have to changing the wheels on a moving train. As a result, I need to be careful not to break anything while improving it. I am learning a lot and satisfied with the work I am doing. I wish I could keep this mindset for a long time. Cheers!
