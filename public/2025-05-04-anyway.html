<p>Well, I just come up with a few interviews that I failed. When I look back, I had interviews a lot of times when I switched jobs at the early stage of my career. As I get experienced, the number of interviews was getting less and the difficulty was getting easier but I still remember that I failed some interviews.</p><p>Here is the thing. As a result, the failure was not a bad thing. Thanks to those failures. When looking back, I'm realizing that I was unprofessional and immature back then. I didn't know what they wanted and didn't think about the career path and goal.</p><p>Anyways, I got a chance to move on a better company and a better job in my perspectives. Every places where I worked gave me a lot of opportunities to learn and grow. I am grateful for that.</p><p>First company tought me general knowledge of the industry, coding, machine learning, software engineering, and project management. In the second company, I wrote a thousands of thousands of lines of code and that was the most immersive experience I've had. In the third company, I learend communication skills and how to deliver features on the top of ongoing projects. In the fourth company, I realized what kinds of colleagues and products I want to work with/work on. In the fifth company, I experienced a functional programming and a manager role. In the sixth company, I saw how to work like Google — but not at Google. In the current company, I'm going through how to make money from the product in huge projects.</p><p>The domain, the number of employees, the structure, the average age, and the nationalities — everything was different from company to company. But one thing is certain: each of them gave me valuable experiences. I'm always grateful for the journey I've been on.</p>
