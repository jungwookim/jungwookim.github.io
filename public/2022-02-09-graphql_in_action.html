 Understanding GraphQL and the design concepts behind it
 How GraphQL differs from alternatives like REST APIs
 Understanding the language used by GraphQL clients and services
 Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of GraphQL
</code></pre><p>GraphQL은 Facebook에서 모바일 어플리케이션에서 발생하는 어떤 기술적 이슈들을 풀기 위해서 만들었다. 하지만 기술적 문제 뿐 아니라 커뮤니케이션 문제들 또한 해결하고 있다고 볼 수 있다.</p><h3 id="1.1_what_is_graphql%3F">1.1 What is GraphQL?</h3><p>GraphQL은 Graph 데이터 구조가 현실 세계의 데이터를 표현하기 가장 좋다고 생각해서 만들어진 말이다. 보통 관계를 생각한다. On the backend, a GraphQL-based stack needs a runtime. That runtime provides a structure for servers to describe the data to be exposed in their APIs. This structure is what we call a schema in the GraphQL world. An API consumer can then use the GraphQL language to construct a text request representing their exact data needs.</p><h4 id="1.1.1_the_big_picture">1.1.1 The big picture</h4><p>While most relational databases directly support SQL, GraphQL is its own thing. GraphQL needs a runtime service. You cannot just start querying databases using the GraphQL query language (at least, not yet). You need to use a service layer that supports GraphQL or implement one yourself.</p><p> GraphQL allows clients to ask for the exact data they need and makes it easier for servers to aggregate data from multiple data storage resources.</p><p>At the core of GraphQL is a strong type system that is used to describe data and organize APIs. This type system gives GraphQL many advantages on both the server and client sides.</p><h4 id="1.1.2_graphql_is_a_specification">1.1.2 GraphQL is a specification</h4><h4 id="1.1.3_graphql_is_a_language">1.1.3 GraphQL is a language</h4><pre><code>GraphQL operations
Queries represent READ operations. Mutations represent WRITE-then-READ operations. You can think of mutations as queries that have side effects.
In addition to queries and mutations, GraphQL also supports a third request type called
a subscription, used for real-time data monitoring requests. Subscriptions represent
continuous READ operations. Mutations usually trigger events for subscriptions.
GraphQL subscriptions require the use of a data-transport channel that supports continuous pushing of data. That’s usually done with WebSockets for web applications.
</code></pre><h3 id="1.2_why_graphql%3F">1.2 Why GraphQL?</h3><p>GraphQL provides comprehensive standards and structures to implement API features in maintainable and scalable ways. GraphQL makes it mandatory for data API servers to publish documentation (the schema) about their capabilities. That schema enables client applications to know everything available for them on these servers. The GraphQL standard schema has to be part of every GraphQL API. Clients can ask the service about its schema using the GraphQL language.</p><h4 id="1.2.1_what_about_rest_apis%3F">1.2.1 What about REST APIs?</h4><p>REST APIs도 customizing을 잘하면 GraphQL처럼 쓸 수는 있지만 별로 안 좋음. over-fetching도 많고, endpoints들이 너무 많다. 다만 caching에서는 약간 유리한 면은 있기는 함.</p><h4 id="1.2.2_the_graphql_way">1.2.2 The GraphQL way</h4><ul><li>The tyed graph schema</li><li>The declarative language</li><li>The single endpoint and client lauguage</li><li>The simple versioning</li></ul><h3 id="1.2.3_rest_apis_and_graphql_apis_in_action">1.2.3 REST APIs and GraphQL APIs in action</h3><p>Good examples!</p><h3 id="1.3_graphql_problems">1.3 GraphQL problems</h3><h4 id="1.3.1_security">1.3.1 Security</h4><p>서버가 공격 당하기 쉬움. 이상한 쿼리 막 날리면... 근데 방어장치는 만들 수 있음. 데이터 limit을 걸 수 있음. allow-list로도 관리할 수 있음 (좀 더 광범위한 어뷰징에 방어)</p><h4 id="1.3.2_caching_and_optimizing">1.3.2 Caching and optimizing</h4><p>정확히는 client caching쪽임. 하지만 graph cache를 이용해 global unique id를 기록해 캐시할 수 있다. 그리고 N+1 SQL quaries 문제도 쉽게 언급된다.

There is also another meta-field, __typename, which can be used to retrieve the name of any object type. Fields with names that begin with double underscore characters are reserved for introspection support. NOTE Meta-fields are implicit. They do not appear in the fields list of their types. The __schema field can be used to read information about the API schema, such as what types and directives it supports. We will explore directives in the next chapter.  Let’s ask the GitHub API schema what types it supports. Here is an introspective query to do that.</p><pre><code>{

Customizing and organizing GraphQL operations</h2><pre><code>This chapter covers
 Using arguments to customize what a request field returns

Examples of single-record fields are popular. Some GraphQL APIs even have a singlerecord field for every object in the system. This is commonly known in the GraphQL world as a <strong>Node <i>interface</i></strong>: a concept popularized by the Relay framework (which also originated at Facebook). With a Node interface, you can look up any node in the data graph by its unique global system-wide ID. Then, based on what that node is, you can use an inline fragment to specify the properties on that node that you are interested in seeing in the response.</p><h4 id="3.1.2_limiting_the_number_of_records_returned_by_a_list_field">3.1.2 Limiting the number of records returned by a list field</h4><p>first, last 등을 사용해서 제한해야한다. By default, the GitHub API orders the repositories in ascending order by date of creation. You can customize that ordering logic with another field argument.</p><h4 id="3.1.3_ordering_records_returned_by_a_list_field">3.1.3 Ordering records returned by a list field</h4><p>Example</p><pre><code>query OrgPopularRepos {
  organization&#40;login: &quot;jscomplete&quot;&#41; {
    repositories&#40;first: 10, orderBy: {field: STARGAZERS, direction: DESC}&#41; {
      nodes {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><h4 id="3.1.4_paginating_through_a_list_of_records">3.1.4 Paginating through a list of records</h4><p>When you need to retrieve a page of records, in addition to specifying a limit, you need to specify an offset. In the GitHub API, you can use the field arguments after and before to offset the results returned by the arguments first and last, respectively.  To use these arguments, you need to work with node identifiers, which are different than database record identifiers. The pagination interface that the GitHub API uses is called the Connection interface (which originated from the Relay framework as well). In that interface, every record is identified by a node field (similar to the Node interface) using a cursor field. The cursor is basically the ID field for each node, and it is the field we use with the before and after arguments.  To work with every node’s cursor next to that node’s data, the Connection interface adds a new parent to the node concept called an edge. The edges field represents a list of paginated records.  Here is a query that includes cursor values through the edges field.</p><p>example) metadata 추가 요청</p><pre><code>query OrgReposMetaInfoExample {
  organization&#40;login: &quot;jscomplete&quot;&#41; {
    repositories&#40;

It is a required argument. You cannot perform a GitHub mutation operation without an input object. All GitHub API mutations use this single required input field argument that represents an object. To perform a mutation, you pass the various input values as key/value pairs on that input object.<h3 id="3.2_renaming_fields_with_aliases">3.2 Renaming fields with aliases</h3> alias example)</p><pre><code>query ProfileInfoWithAlias {

    bio
  }
}
</code></pre><h3 id="3.3_customizing_responses_with_directives">3.3 Customizing responses with directives</h3><p> A <i>directive</i> in a GraphQL request is a way to provide a GraphQL server with additional information about the execution and type validation behavior of a GraphQL document. It is essentially a more powerful version of field arguments: you can use directives to conditionally include or exclude an entire field. In addition to fields, directives can be used with fragments and top-level operations.  A directive is any string in a GraphQL document that begins with the @ character. Every GraphQL schema has three built-in directives: @include, @skip, and @deprecated. Some schemas have more directives. You can use this introspective query to see the list of directives supported by a schema.</p><h4 id="3.3.1_variables_and_input_values">3.3.1 Variables and input values</h4><p>A <i>variable</i> is simply any name in the GraphQL document that begins with a $ sign: for example, $login or $showRepositories. The name after the $ sign can be anything. We use variables to make GraphQL operations generically reusable and avoid having to hardcode values and concatenate strings.</p><h4 id="3.3.2_the_%40include_directive">3.3.2 The @include directive</h4><p><code>fieldName @include&#40;if: $someTest&#41;</code> @skip 반대.</p><h4 id="3.3.3_the_%40skip_directive">3.3.3 The @skip directive</h4><p><code>fieldName @skip&#40;if: $someTest&#41;</code> @include 반대.<h4 id="3.3.4_the_%40deprecated_directive">3.3.4 The @deprecated directive</h4></p><pre><code>type User {

}
</code></pre><h3 id="3.4_graphql_fragments">3.4 GraphQL fragments</h3><h4 id="3.4.1_why_fragments%3F">3.4.1 Why fragments?</h4><p> In GraphQL, fragments are the composition units of the language. They provide a way to split big GraphQL operations into smaller parts. A fragment in GraphQL is simply a reusable piece of any GraphQL operation.  I like to compare GraphQL fragments to UI components. Fragments, if you will, are the components of a GraphQL operation.  Splitting a big GraphQL document into smaller parts is the main advantage of GraphQL fragments. However, fragments can also be used to avoid duplicating a group of fields in a GraphQL operation. We will explore both benefits, but let’s first understand the syntax for defining and using fragments. <h4 id="3.4.2_defining_and_using_fragments">3.4.2 Defining and using fragments</h4> example)</p><pre><code>fragment orgFields on Organization {
  name
  description
  websiteUrl
}
</code></pre><p> The on Organization part of the definition is called the type condition of the fragment. Since a fragment is essentially a selection set, you can only define fragments on object types. You cannot define a fragment on a scalar value. spread example)</p><pre><code>query OrgInfoWithFragment {
  organization&#40;login: &quot;jscomplete&quot;&#41; {
    ...orgFields
  }
}
</code></pre><h4 id="3.4.3_fragments_and_dry">3.4.3 Fragments and DRY</h4><p>DRY가 Framents를 사용하면 좋아진다. 더 좋은 건 바로 다음 장에 나온다.<h4 id="3.4.4_fragments_and_ui_components">3.4.4 Fragments and UI components</h4></p><h4 id="3.4.5_inline_fragments_for_interfaces_and_unions">3.4.5 Inline fragments for Interfaces and unions</h4><p>Inline fragments can be used as a type condition when querying against an interface or a union. The bolded part in the query in listing 3.34 is an inline fragment on the Commit type within the target object interface; so, to understand the value of inline fragments, you first need to understand the concepts of unions and interfaces in GraphQL.  Interfaces and unions are abstract types in GraphQL. An interface defines a list of “shared” fields, and a union defines a list of possible object types. Object types in a GraphQL schema can implement an interface that guarantees that the implementing object type will have the list of fields defined by the implemented interface. Object types defined as unions guarantee that what they return will be one of the possible types of that union.</p><p>질문) Object types은 intercface를 구현한다 질문) inline fragment가 type condition을 표현한다는게 무슨 말인지 잘 모르겠다 -> 아 이제 알겠다. 해당 인터페이스가 있을 때 해당 값을 가져오는 거구나. 그게 동시에 union type이 될 수 있고.</p><p>example query)</p><pre><code>query RepoUnionExampleFull {

</code></pre><p>!는 non-nullable을 의미한다. The id and createdAt fields are examples of how GraphQL schema types don’t have to exactly match the column types in your database. GraphQL gives you flexibility for casting one type from the database into a more useful type for the client. Try to spot other examples of this as we progress through the API.</p><h3 id="4.3_queries">4.3 Queries</h3><h4 id="4.3.1_listing_the_lastest_task_records">4.3.1 Listing the lastest Task records</h4><pre><code>query {
  taskMainList {
    id
    content
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Note that I named the root field taskMainList instead of a more natural name like mainTaskList. This is just a style preference, but it has an advantage: by putting the subject of the action (task, in this case) first, all actions on that subject will naturally be grouped alphabetically in file trees and API explorers.</p><pre><code>type Query {
  taskMainList: &#91;Task!&#93;
  # More query root fields
}
</code></pre><pre><code>Root field nullability
However, root fields are special because making them nullable has an important consequence. In GraphQL.js implementations, when an error
is thrown in any field’s resolver, the built in executor resolves that field with null.
When an error is thrown in a resolver for a field that is defined as non-null, the executor propagates the nullability to the field’s parent instead. If that parent field is also
non-null, the executor continues up the tree until it finds a nullable field.
This means if the root taskMainList field were to be made non-null, then when an
error is thrown in its resolver, the nullability will propagate to the Query type &#40;its parent&#41;. So the entire data response for a query asking for this field would be null, even
if the query had other root fields.
This is not ideal. One bad root field should not block the data response of other root
fields. When we start implementing this GraphQL API in the next chapter, we will see
an example.
This is why I made the taskMainList nullable, and it’s why I will make all root fields
nullable. The semantic meaning of this nullability is, in this case, “Something went
wrong in the resolver of this root field, and we’re allowing it so that a response can
still have partial data for other root fields.”

 Reading data from MongoDB
</code></pre><h3 id="7.1_caching_and_batching">7.1 Caching and Batching</h3><p> Caching — The least we can do is cache the response of any SQL statements issued and then use the cache the next time we need the exact same SQL statement. If we ask the database about user x, do not ask it again about user x; just use the previous response. Doing this in a single API request (from one consumer) is a no-brainer, but you can also use longer-term, multisession caching if you need to optimize things further. However, caching by itself is not enough. We also need to group queries asking for data from the same tables.</p><p> Batching — We can delay asking the database about a certain resource until we figure out the IDs of all the records that need to be resolved. Once these IDs are identified, we can use a single query that takes in a list of IDs and returns the list of records for them. This enables us to issue a SQL statement per table, and doing so will reduce the number of SQL statements required for the simple query in listing 7.2 to just two: one for the azdev.tasks table and one for the azdev.users table.</p><h2 id="chapter_8._implementing_mutations">Chapter 8. Implementing mutations</h2><pre><code>This chapter covers
 Implementing GraphQL’s mutation fields
 Authenticating users for mutation and query
operations
 Creating custom, user-friendly error messages
 Using powerful database features to optimize
mutations
</code></pre><h3 id="8.1_the_mutators_context_object">8.1 The mutators context object</h3><p>A mutation can contain multiple fields, resulting in the server executing multiple database WRITE/READ operations. However, unlike query fields, which are executed in parallel, mutation fields run in a series, one after the other. If an API consumer sends two mutation fields, the first is guaranteed to finish before the second begins. This is to ensure that a race condition does not happen, but it also complicates the task of something like DataLoader.</p><ul><li>퀴즈1) datatime return값은 datestring보다 timestamp를 권장한다.
