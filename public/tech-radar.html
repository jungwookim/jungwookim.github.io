    <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
    
    <p>
    The Personal Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. It uses four rings with the following semantics:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
    <li><strong>PROFICIENT</strong> &mdash; Technologies that I have high confidence in and use regularly in my work. These are well-understood, low-risk technologies that I recommend for widespread use in my personal or professional work.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>DEVELOPING</strong> &mdash;Technologies that I have experienced a bit and am deepening my knowledge of. I have used these in some projects with positive results, and I am continuing to refine my skills with them. These technologies are slightly more risky as I'm still developing their full potential and limitations.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>EXPLORING</strong> &mdash; Technologies that I have less experienced and are promising and have potential value for my future work. I am investing time in research and prototyping to understand if these technologies could have a significant impact. These are often new or less familiar technologies that I'm experimenting with to assess their benefits and risks.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>ARCHIEVED</strong> &mdash; Technologies that I have basic understanding of but do not currently use extensively. These are technologies I might have used in the past or learned at a foundational level, but they are not central to my current projects or focus areas.</li>
    <br/>
  </ul>
