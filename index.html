        <h1 id="how_online_ads_really_work">How Online Ads Really Work</h1><p>I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Unity, working on Tapjoy Offerwall, a ad solution for mobile games and apps. In this post, I want to demysify how online ads work, especially in the context of mobile games and app. It won't cover every detail but will give you a solid understanding of the ecosystem, the players involved, and how it all comes together. Plus, I won't explain Offerwall itself, but rather focus on the broader ad tech landscape that makes it possible.</p><h2 id="introduction%3A_ads_are_everywhere_%E2%80%94_but_how_do_they_work%3F">Introduction: Ads Are Everywhere — But How Do They Work?</h2><p>When you play games or browse the web, you see ads everywhere. I knew that ads are everywhere but I didn't know how they really work even though I have been working on the Ads team. This article is for those who want to understand the ad tech ecosystem. I will explain key actors, how they interact, and the techonology behind it with top-down approach. I wish you will get a better understanding of how online ads works after reading this post.<h2></h2></p><h2 id="the_big_picture%3A_online_advertising_ecosystem">The Big Picture: Online Advertising Ecosystem</h2><p>There are key players in the online advertising ecosystem that work together to deliver ads to users. Here's a high-level overview:</p><ul><li>Advertisers: Companies that want to promote their products or services.</li><li>Publishers: Websites or apps that display ads to their users.</li><li>Ad Networks: Middlemen that connect advertisers with publishers.</li><li>DSPs (Demand Side Platforms): Tools that help advertisers buy ad space programmatically.</li><li>SSPs (Supply Side Platforms): Tools that help publishers sell ad space programmatically.</li><li>Ad Exchanges: Marketplaces where DSPs and SSPs transact.</li><li>MMPs (Mobile Measurement Partners): Companies that track ad performance and user acquisition.</li></ul><p>That's a lot of jargon, but don't worry. I'll break it down in the following sections. Before that, here's a high-level diagram of the ecosystem:</p><pre class="language-mermaid"><code class="lang-mermaid language-mermaid">flowchart TD

        <p>Well, I just come up with a few interviews that I failed. When I look back, I had interviews a lot of times when I switched jobs at the early stage of my career. As I get experienced, the number of interviews was getting less and the difficulty was getting easier but I still remember that I failed some interviews.</p><p>Here is the thing. As a result, the failure was not a bad thing. Thanks to those failures. When looking back, I'm realizing that I was unprofessional and immature back then. I didn't know what they wanted and didn't think about the career path and goal.</p><p>Anyways, I got a chance to move on a better company and a better job in my perspectives. Every places where I worked gave me a lot of opportunities to learn and grow. I am grateful for that.</p><p>First company tought me general knowledge of the industry, coding, machine learning, software engineering, and project management. In the second company, I wrote a thousands of thousands of lines of code and that was the most immersive experience I've had. In the third company, I learend communication skills and how to deliver features on the top of ongoing projects. In the fourth company, I realized what kinds of colleagues and products I want to work with/work on. In the fifth company, I experienced a functional programming and a manager role. In the sixth company, I saw how to work like Google — but not at Google. In the current company, I'm going through how to make money from the product in huge projects.</p><p>The domain, the number of employees, the structure, the average age, and the nationalities — everything was different from company to company. But one thing is certain: each of them gave me valuable experiences. I'm always grateful for the journey I've been on.</p>

        <p>I have been working at Unity for 6 months now. One sentence summary: I am happy to be here. Nice people, great work, and a good environment. Nothing prevents me from doing my best work. The product that I am working on is running well, so we have to changing the wheels on a moving train. As a result, I need to be careful not to break anything while improving it. I am learning a lot and satisfied with the work I am doing. I wish I could keep this mindset for a long time. Cheers!</p>
